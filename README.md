# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

## Recommended Node.js version

This project is tested with **Node.js 18–22**. If you run into module resolution errors,
please install Node 18 or 20 and reinstall dependencies.

## Windows prerequisites (npm/yarn not recognized)

If your terminal says **`'npm' is not recognized`** or **`'yarn' is not recognized`**,
Node.js is either missing or not on your PATH.

1. Install **Node.js 18 LTS** or **20 LTS** from https://nodejs.org.
2. Close and re-open your terminal.
3. Verify that Node and npm are available:

   ```bash
   node -v
   npm -v
   ```

4. Install Yarn (if needed):

   ```bash
   npm install -g yarn
   yarn -v
   ```

If the commands still fail, re-run the Node.js installer and ensure the
**“Add to PATH”** option is checked.

## Run commands from the frontend folder

This repository has a separate `frontend` package. If you run `yarn start`
from the repo root, Yarn will not find the correct `package.json`.

```bash
cd C:\Users\fevzi\Desktop\demartwebsitesonxx-main\frontend
yarn install
yarn start
```

If you see **`'craco' is not recognized`**, it means dependencies were not installed
in the `frontend` folder. Re-run `yarn install` there and try again.

These steps apply regardless of locale; the production build ships both TR and EN content.


Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
